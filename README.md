The code makes it possible to calculate investments in rental properties, provided the property is covered by a loan.
Based on the data provided by users, the programme will calculate the key indicators for the property. The data is saved in 3 tables (income and expenditure in the first year, key indicators for x years of investment, breakdown of key indicators over time) in an Excel file.
